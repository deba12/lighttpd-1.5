Description
===========

You have a page containing images and want to make sure that noone is
linking the images directly somewhere else. You want that the images can
only be seen if you reference the covering page too.

requesting the protected files is forbidden as long as the
triggering-page (the covering page) is not requested first.

Options
=======

::
  trigger-before-download.db-filename = "/var/share/lighttpd/trigger.db"
  trigger-before-download.trigger-url = "^/trigger/"
  trigger-before-download.download-url = "^/download/"
  trigger-before-download.deny-url = "http://www.example.org/"
  trigger-before-download.trigger-timeout = 10

.trigger-url has to be requested before any download to .download-url is
allowed. Denying access means here a redirect to .deny-url.
.trigger-timeout seconds after the request if the .trigger-url the
download is forbidden again. The information is stored in a gdbm
database referenced in .db-filename
