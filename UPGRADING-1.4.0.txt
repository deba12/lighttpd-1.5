lighttpd 1.4.0 will make a few things differently than previous 
releases:

1. index-files are now handled by by mod_indexfile

   server.indexfiles = ( "index.html", "index.html" )
   
   becomes
   
   server.modules = ( ..., "mod_indexfile", ... )
   
   index-file.extensions = ( "index.html", "index.html" )
   
2. directory listings are handled by mod_dirlisting now

   server.dir-listing = "enable"
   
   becomes
   
   server.modules = ( ..., "mod_dirlisting", ... )
   
   dir-listing.active = "enable"

3. IMPORTANT: static files are now handled by mod_staticfile

   This is the most important change. Static-files are now handled 
   by mod_staticfile. If you don't load mod_staticfile you will 
   always get a 403 error-page.
   
   server.modules = ( ..., "mod_staticfile", ... )
   
   static-file.exclude-extensions = ( ".php", ".cgi", ".fcgi" )

You will get a ERROR if you use 

- server.indexfiles or
- server.dir-listing
