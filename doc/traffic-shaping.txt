Description
===========

Starting with 1.3.8 lighttpd supports limiting the bandwith for a single connection 
or config-context like virtual-host or URL. 

Options
=======

:connection.kbytes-per-second:
  limit the through-put for each single connection to the given 
  limit in kbyte/s
  
  default: 0 (no limit)

:server.kbytes-per-second:
  limit the through-put for all connections to the given limit 
  in kbyte/s
  
  if you want to specify a limit for a special virtual server 
  use: ::
  
    $HTTP["host"] == "www.example.org" {
      server.kbytes-per-second = 128
    }
  
  which will overwrite the default for this host. 
  
  default: 0 (no limit)

Additional Notes
================

Keep in mind that a limit below 32kb/s might actually limit the traffic to 32kb/s. This 
is caused by by the size of the TCP-sendbuffer.
