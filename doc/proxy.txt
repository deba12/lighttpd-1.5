Options
=======

lighttpd provides the Proxy support via the proxy-module 
(mod_proxy) which provides 2 options in the config-file:

:proxy.debug:
  a value between 0 and 65535 to set the debug-level in the 
  Proxy module. Currently only 0 and 1 are used. Use 1 to 
  enable some debug output, 0 to disable it.

:proxy.server:
  tell the module where to send Proxy requests to. Every 
  file-extension can have its own handler. Load-Balancing is 
  done by specifying multiple handles for the same extension.
  
  structure of proxy.server section: ::
  
    ( <extension> => 
      ( <handle> => 
        ( "host" => <string> ,
          "port" => <integer>
	)
      ), 
      ( <handle> => ... 
      )
    )
  
  :<extension>: is the file-extension or prefix 
                (if started with "/")
  :<handle>:    is just a unique handle name
  :"host":      is ip of the proxy server
  :"port":      is tcp-port on the "host" used by the proxy
                server

  e.g.: ::
  
    proxy.server = ( ".php" =>
  		       ( "grisu" => 
		         ( 
		           "host" => "192.168.0.2",
		           "port" => 1026
		         )
		       )
		     )
